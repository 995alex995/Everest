# What's this?
This project has been forked from [Rohit Awate](https://github.com/RohitAwate).

We will be using it to learn about JavaFX in the context of an already existing codebase.

# To get it running...
1. Clone this repository.
2. From Eclipse, File > Import > Existing Maven Projects.
3. Under src/main/java > com.rohitawakte.everest, right click Launcher, and Run As > Java Application.

# Exercises

0. Play with the color theme if you like.
1. Change the color of "GET" in the history pane to something other than red.
2. Add a button that clears the results from the history pane.
<br>*//watch the second video*<br>
3. Warn the user before exiting when the last tab is closed. You could use the JavaFX [Alert](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Alert.html) class for this, but it's up to you.
4. Get the copy button working.
